\section Weight_Interface_Intro Introduction

Many geometric algorithms rely on the weighted constructions. In \cgal, weights
are often used to setup different optimization problems based on the discretized
Laplacian or when computing coordinates of a point with respect to polygons. This
package provides a simple and unified interface to different types of weights.

In particular, the following \cgal packages depend on this package:
\ref PkgBarycentricCoordinates2 "2D Generalized Barycentric Coordinates",
\ref PkgPolygonMeshProcessing "Polygon Mesh Processing",
\ref PkgSurfaceMeshParameterization "Triangulated Surface Mesh Parameterization",
\ref PkgSurfaceMeshSkeletonization "Triangulated Surface Mesh Skeletonization",
\ref PkgSurfaceMeshDeformation "Triangulated Surface Mesh Deformation",
\ref PkgHeatMethodSummary "The Heat Method".


\section Weight_Interface_Weights Analytic Weights

We call *analytic weights* all weights, which can be computed analytically.
In particular, we have two subgroups of such weights:

- \ref PkgWeightInterfaceRefWeights "weights",
which can be computed for a point with respect to its local neighbors in 2D or 3D;
- \ref PkgWeightInterfaceRefBarycentric "weights",
which can be computed for a point with respect to a polygon in XY or any other plane.

The last group of weights is used in the package
\ref PkgBarycentricCoordinates2 "Barycentric Coordinates 2".


\section Weight_Interface_Weighting_Regions Weighting Regions

We call *weighting regions* a set of weights, which are used to balance other
weights, and are rarely used on their own. Sometimes such weights are referred as
local averaging regions.

These \ref PkgWeightInterfaceRefRegions "weights" are usually lengths, areas, and
volumes of 2D and 3D objects.


\section Weight_Interface_Examples Examples

In this section, you can find a few examples of how and when the provided
weights can be used.


\subsection Weight_Interface_Examples_Weights First Example

This trivial example shows how to compute both 2D and 3D analytic weights.
The weight is computed at the query point `q` with respect to its neighbors `t`, `r`,
and `p` either in 2D or 3D.

This trivial example shows how to compute both 2D and 3D weighting regions.
The computed weights are all areas of the corresponding regions being a part of a
triangle `[p, q, r]` either in 2D or 3D.

\cgalExample{Weight_interface/weight_interface.cpp}


\subsection Weight_Interface_Examples_CoordinatesOneQuery Computing 2D Coordinates for One Query

This example shows how to compute barycentric weights and barycentric coordinates,
which are normalized barycentric weights, for a query point with respect to a polygon
in 2D. Since we have only one query point, we use a free function to show the simplified
interface. For multiple query points though, calling a free function is not efficient
(see the following example for more details). The used type of barycentric weights is
`Discrete_harmonic_weights_2`.

\cgalExample{Weight_interface/coordinates_one_query.cpp}


\subsection Weight_Interface_Examples_CoordinatesMultipleQueries Computing 2D Coordinates for Multiple Query Points

This example shows how to compute barycentric weights and barycentric coordinates,
which are normalized barycentric weights, for a set of query points with respect to
a polygon in 2D. Since we have multiple query points, we first create a class and then
use it to compute the weights. Using a class for multiple query points is preferred, because
in that case, the memory required to compute weights is allocated only once, while
when using a free function as in the previous example, it is allocated for each query point.
The used type of barycentric weights is `Wachspress_weights_2`.

\cgalExample{Weight_interface/coordinates_multiple_queries.cpp}


\subsection Weight_Interface_Examples_ProjectionTraits Computing 2D Weights in 3D

If you have a 2D polygon in 3D plane that is not an XY plane, you can still compute
the 2D weights, however you need to provide a special projection traits class. This example
shows how to achieve that when using the `Mean_value_weights_2`
type of barycentric weights.

You can also use such traits when computing
\ref PkgWeightInterfaceRefWeights "local analytic weights" or
\ref PkgWeightInterfaceRefRegions "local weighting regions".

\cgalExample{Weight_interface/projection_traits.cpp}


\subsection Weight_Interface_Examples_CustomTraits Weights with Custom Traits

As you could see from the previous example, it is possible to provide your own traits
class with basic geometric objects, constructions, and predicates required by the algorithm.
All weights in this \cgal component are models of the `AnalyticWeightTraits_2` and `AnalyticWeightTraits_3`
concepts. However, many weights do not require all objects from these concepts. This example shows that
the inverse distance weight, for instance, requires only the squared distance object, which is specified
in the custom traits class.

\cgalExample{Weight_interface/custom_traits.cpp}


\subsection Weight_Interface_Examples_WeightedLaplacian Constructing Weighted Laplacian

A typical example of using weights is discretizing Poisson and Laplace
equations, which play an important role in various geometry processing applications
such as, for example, \ref PkgSurfaceMeshDeformation "surface mesh deformation" and
\ref PkgSurfaceMeshParameterization "surface mesh parameterization". This example shows
how to write the discretized Laplacian for all vertices of the given triangle mesh in
matrix notation. We use the standard cotangent discretization weighted by the areas of
the mixed Voronoi cells around each mesh vertex.

\cgalExample{Weight_interface/weighted_laplacian.cpp}


\subsection Weight_Interface_Examples_Flattening Flattening and Convergence

When computing weights for a query point `q` with respect to its neighbors
`t`, `r`, and `p` as shown in the first example, the local configuration is a quadrilateral
`[q, t, r, p]` or two connected triangles `[r, q, t]` and `[p, q, r]`.

When computing 3D weights, these triangles are not necessarily coplanar. When they are not
coplanar, we make them coplanar, since several weights cannot be compute in such cases,
however this so-called flattening introduces a distortion since the weights are computed
not with respect to the original configuration but to its flattened version. This example
shows this distortion and how it decreases when the point `q` moves back to the original
non-flat configuration.

Moreover, this example shows how to use the family of weights, which includes
multiple types of weights in one function. In particular, we show how by
changing an input parameter, we converge from the Wachspress weights to the mean value
weights.
