* Regenerate contour figures.
* Remove all unnecessary functions.
* Add benchmark graphs to the user manual.
* Add unique segments section in the user manual with the figure. Mention: Unique segments can later be converted into lines.

* Install OSQP on all testing platforms.
* When adding the QP_solver concept in the next package release, I should put it in the Solver_interface and refactor the MixedIntegerConcept, too.
* Add a 3D version of the QP regularization algorithm.
* Add an opencv tutorial with the global segments regularization over the Chicago map.
